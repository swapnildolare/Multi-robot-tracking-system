# Multi-robot-tracking-system
- Developed a system capable of monitoring swarm robots using affordable hardware readily accessible to users, including a webcam, ArUco markers, Raspberry Pi, M5Stack Core 2 (IoT), and Pololu robots.
- Implemented Python scripts and ArUco markers for each robot to establish distinct detection patterns for up to 100 robots, facilitating individual identification within the swarm.
